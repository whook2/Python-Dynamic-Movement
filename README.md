# Python: Dynamic Movement
This program implements and tests the dynamic movement update and dynamic movement behaviors Seek, Flee, and Arrive.
The pseudocode for the algorithms are sourced from the textbook "Artificial Intelligence for Games, 3rd Edition" by 
Millington. The program sends each characters information to an output file in 0.5 simulated second increments. The provided plotting program then reads the text file, and generates a graph.
